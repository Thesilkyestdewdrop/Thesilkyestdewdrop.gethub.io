                    <p>"Destroyer" Milim Nava<br/> 「"破壊の暴君デストロイ" ミリム・ナーヴァ,<br/>is one of the oldest and strongest Demon Lords, and the third True Demon Lord to come into existence. She is the one and only existing Dragonoid with the nickname of Destroyer, and often called a tyrant because of her childishly irritable personality combined with her power.<br/><br/>

                    Even among a dissolved group of the Ten Great Demon Lords, she is a Demon Lord one should never fight against, being the only other being, aside from Rimuru, to have the ability to use an infinite amount of Magicules.

                     <h3>Normal Form</h3>
                    <p>Although Milim is a Dragonoid, she looks like a regular human child about the age of 10 to 13, making many people confuse her as a harmless existence at first.<br/>

                     She has glossy pink hair (white/silver in the Web Novel akin to her mother) tied in twin-tails. She usually wears a black skimpy gothic dress that barely covers her body.<br/>
                    Afterward, she also started to wear the Dragon Knuckles that Rimuru gifted her.

                    <p>In this form, Milim actually looks more like the Dragonoid that she is, having a crimson horn adorning her forehead and jet black armor adorning her body. She also sprouts wings, revealing her existence as the special, one-and-only, being that she is.</p>

                    <h3>Personality</h3>
                    <p>She is the most short-tempered and simple Demon Lord, what the rest would consider common sense is completely lost on her. However, though she might be a short-tempered simpleton, she is by no means stupid.<br/>

                    There's a possibility that she doesn't have many friends. It can be speculated that she's been living for so long that she must have lost many good friends by now.<br/>

                    She has a complete lack of dishonesty and is honest to an extreme. Milim probably hasn't even heard the word “negotiation”. She boldly declares her demands and rampages if they are rejected. She, unfortunately, believes that if you are working, there is no need to hide anything.<br>

                    Though Milim is by no means stupid, she is called short-tempered and impudent, but that is not true. Moreover, she possesses an abnormal perception, so fooling her proves to be difficult.</p>
